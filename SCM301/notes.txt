Introduction to supply chain management
Companies produce goods and services
SILOS are when different parts of firms don't talk to each other

What is a Supply Chain? (see slides for all of these things)
A supply chain consists of hte flow of products, services, money, and information from:
	raw materials manufacturers
	Component an dintermediate manufacturers
	Final product manufacutrers
	Wholesalers and distributors and retailers
Connected by transportation and integrated through information, planning, and other ocordination activities.
((Customers))

Supply chain management can be defined a few different ways. 
The design and management of seamless, value-added process across organizational boundaries to meet the real needs of the end customer ~ institute for supply mainagement
managing supply and demand, sourcing raw materials and parts, manufacturing and assembly, warehousing and inventory tracking, order entry and order management, distribution across all channels, and delivery to the customer ~ the supply chain council
The planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities... also includes coordination with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers and customers. ~ council of supply chain management professionals

Pantene Shampoo (see slides)
They have a bunch of things up in the air they need to deal with

The book takes supply chain and splits it into the following
supply management + Operations Management + Logistics
get the bits + put em together + get em to the customers
integration combines all of the above. 

Additional foundations include supply elements;
	supplier management
		evaluation
		certification
	Strategic partnerships. 
Operations elements:
	Demand management
	MRP and ERP systems
	Lean systems
	Six Sigma
logistic elements:
	Transportation management
	warehouse management
	global logistics
Importance of Supply Chain Management
	Firms using supply chian management:
		start with key suppliers
		move on to other suppliers, customers, and shippers
		integrate second tier suppliers and customers
	Cost savings and better coordination of resources
		reduced bullwhip effect
Origins of Supply Chain Management
	1950s and 1960s
		US manufacutrers focused on mass production techniques as their principal cost reduction and productivitiy improvement strategies
		generally demand was greater than supply
	1960s and 1970s
		Introduction of new computer technlology lead to develpment of materials requirements plannign and manufacutrre resource planning to coodinate inventory management and improve internal communication
	80s and 90s
		Intense global competition led us manufacturers to adopt:
			supply Chain Management
			Just In Time
			Total quality management
			Buinsess Porcess Reengineering Practices
	2000s and beyond
		industrial buyers wil rely more on 3rd party logistics providers and shit dawg. 

Expanding the Supply Chain
	Firms are expanding partnerships and building facilitiees in foreign markets
	The expansion inviolves:
		breadth: foreign manufacutring, office, and retail site,s foreign duppliers and customers
		depth: second and thir dtier customers and suppliers
	Increasing supply chin responsiveness
		all sorts of crazy stuff they're trying to do. 
	The greening of supply chains
		Increasing the sustainability. 
A really brief history of purchasing
	Prominatory point: where railroads met 
Purchasing - key business function for acquiring materials, services and equipment
contracting - term often used for the acquisition of services
supply management - a newer term that encompasses all acquisition activities
Material Requisiton/Purchase Requesition ("req")
	states product, quanitty, and delivery date
	may originate as a planned order release from the MRP system
	traveling requisition used for recurring orders. 
Request for quotation/Proposal (RFQ/RFP
	Is the buyer's offer
Make or buy decision:
	Outsourcing
	Vertical integration
		backward
		forward
	Reasons for buying or outsourcing
		cost advantage (maybe)
		insufficient capacity
		lack of expertise
		quality
		strategic benefits of using best-in-class suppliers
		greater flexibility in the purchase of rapidly developing new technologies
		design cycle time reduction
		less captial is required -> risk transferred to the supplier
		technology
	Reasons for making
		Protect proprietary technology
		No component supplier
		Better quality control
		Use existing idle capacity
		Control of lead-time, transportatoin, and warehousing cost
		lower cost (per unit, usually)
	make vs buy analysis assumptions
		all costs can be classified as fixed or variabble
		fixed costs remain the same
		a lineral variable cost relationship exists
		the fixed cost of the make option is highter because of initial capital investment (equipment)
		variable cost of buy option is higher because of supplier profits

	Recent trends in supply chain management
		Outsourccing
		focusing of operations
		supply base reductoin
		long-term buyer supplier elationships
		partnerships rather than adversarial trading
	How many suppliers to use
		Reasons to have a single supplier
			to establish a relationship
			less quality variability
			lower cost
			transportation economies
			proprietary product or process
			volume too small to split
		reasons to have multiple suppliers
			need capacity
			spread risk of suppply interruption
			create competition
			information
			dealing with special kinds of business
	Total cost of ownership
Successful partnerships
	Achieve win-win
	require a strategic perspective and such
keys to succcessful partnerships
	building trust
	shared vision and objectives
	personal relationships
	mutual benefits and needs
	commitment and top management support
	Change Management
	Information sharing and lines of communicaiton
Challenges to managing relationships
	sharing information and maintaining confidentiality
	R & D and proprietary information
	satisfying customer expectations
	power in the chain
Vendor managed inventories
3rd party logistics services

Purchasing: Centralized vs decentralized
	Does headquarters get to make the decision or does the local office do it?

Forecasting: The forecast is always wrong
##extra credit##	4 points to tattoo "the forecast is always wrong" anywhere visible in busines clothing
Demand forecasting (guessing)
	estimate of future demand
	underlying basis of all business decisions
		production
		inventory
		personnel
		facilities
	Goal is to minimize forecast error
	math =/= Business
	
	Independent demand: finished goods
	dependent demand: raw materials, component parts, sub assemblies, etc.

	What can a firm do to manage an independent demand:
		Active role to influence demand
			pricing strategies
			advertising
		passive role and simply respond to demand
			adjusting capacity
	forecasting techniques
		qualitative: based on opinion and intuition
			generally used when data are limited, unavailable, or not currently relevant
		quantitative: uses mathematical models and historical data
			time series analysis
			causal relationships
			simulation
	Why?
		Average - average demand for a period of time
		trend - increasing or decreasing
		cyclical variations - wavelike movements that are longer than a year, usually due to the busines cycle
		seasonal element - peaks and valeys that repeat over a consistent interval
		random variation - due to unexpected or unpredictable events
	qualitative methods
		data unavailable, very limited, or not relevant

		jury of executive opinion
		sales force composite "how many do you think you're going to sell"
		customer surveys
		delphi method
			choose experts
			get forecasts from everyone
			summarize the results and redistribute them with new questions
			summarize again, refining forecasts and develop new quesitiosn
			rinse and repeat.

		Time series analysis
			take past history and use it to predict the future
			pick models based on 
				time horizon to forecast
				data availability
				accuracy required
				size of forecasting budget
				availability of qualitfied personnel
			Naive forecast
				take the previous period data and use the past period
	In this chapter we cover 3 basic methods:
		simple moving aveerage
			The average of however many periods in the past you want to look at. 
		weighted moving average
			same thing as above, but weigh the ones closer to now higher than the others. 
		exponential smoothing

		F_t+1 = \alphaA_t+(1-\alpha)F_t
		where f_t = forecast for period t
		f_t+1 = Forecast for period t+1
		A_t = Actual demand for period t
		\alpha = A smoothing constant

		or equivalently
		F_t+1 = F_t + \alpha(A_t - F_t)
		
		forecast tomorrow by taking today's forecast, and adjusting it by some amount (actual sales - forecast from today)*\alpha aka some constant
		
	forecast error
		What is the goal of a good forecast?
			minimize forecast error
			we need to measure the error in the forecast
			Consistency of error is also helpful
			error: error = actual-forecasted
			Running sum of forecast error
				idealy 0
		mean square error;
			take the average of the errors squared.
			it penalizes the frickfrack out of large errors

LOOK AT YOUR DATA

Tracking signal
	take the running sum of forecast error. divide it by the MAD
	ts=rsfe/mad
	measures bias
	should be between 4 and -4 and not have a pattern




AFTER THE FORECAST(which is wrong):
forecast => Resource Plan
how much do we need? => How much should we make?
Operations planning overview
Long-range planning
	Greater than one year planning horizon
	usually with yearly increments
intermediate-range planning
	six to eighteen months
	usually with monthly or quarterly increments
Short range planning
	one dat to less than six months
	usually with weekly increments

aggregate planning
Goal: Specify the optimal combination of 
	production rate
	workforce level
	inventory on hand
Product group or broad category -- family aggregation
Aggregate scheduling Goals
	meet demand
	use capacity efficiently
key strategies for meeting demand
chase-match production to customer order rate by hiring and laying off employees
level-stable workforce with constant output, inventory and backlogs absorb fluctuation s in demand
combination of the two - stable workforce, variable hours - vary output through overtime or flexible schedules
	hybrid
Costs relevant to aggregate planning
	direct labor
	changing the production rate
	inventory holding
	backordering
Aggregate planning
	forecasted Demand
	Beginning Inventory - negative indicates backlog
	net requirements
	production choice

Why material requirements planning?
	Planned order release
Material requirements palnning defined
	materials requirements planning is the logic for determining the number of parts, components, and materias needed to produce a product

deriving EOQ = sqrt(2RS/kC)
when you do the derivative of the total cost of Q, you'll end oup with a two in there somewhere. Don't forget it. 

What inventory level should be maintained?
	if both demand and lead time are constant
	Reorder point, ROP = dbar x LT
		dbar = Average Demand
		LT = Lead Time
Gotta get some safety stock (SS)
use statistics to make sure your safety stock is good

	sigma_d is the standard deviation of demand
	sigma_LT is the standard deviation of lead time
	z is the number of standard deviations for a specified service probability

ROP = dbar X LTbar + SS
SS=z*sqrt((sigma^2_LT * d^-2)+(sigma^2_d*LTbar))

When should orders be placed/
continuous review systme
	fixed order quantity model
		event triggered
	allows for random demand
	stock position is monitored continuously
Periodic Review System
	Fixed-time period model
		time triggered
	assume demand is random
	order up to the target level at a specified time
Two bin system
	pull from one bin
		when it is empty order more and use the other bin
		ad infinitum
How much effort goes to inventory management?
	ABC Method of inventory analysis
		determine annual $ usage
		rank the items according to anual $ usage
	
Evaluating Inventory Management
	Inventoy investment
		firms should diligently measure inventory investment to ensure that it does not adversely affect competitiveness.
		Measures include
			absolute value of inventory (from balance sheet)
			inventory turnover or turnover ration - how many times inventory turns in an accounting period

			inventory Turnover ration = cost of revenue/ average inventory = cost of goods sold/ average aggregate inventory level
Distribution Center size
	typically large is 2million square feet
	
Basic Warehouse Operations
	Movement
		receiving
		put away
		order picking
		shipping
	storage
		stock location
		warehouse management system (WMS)
	Good space Utilization "Cube"
Warehouse Productivity metrics
	pounds or units per day
	employees per pound moved
	pounds unloaded, loaded, or picked per hour
	orders filled correctly
	productivity ration = (pounds/day)/(labour hours/day)
	Trhoughput = material moved through it. 
Overall trends in Warehousing
	expansion beyond traditional services
		Value-added packaging or manufacturing
	Third party providers
		new and growing industry
		emphasis on dedicated/customized services
	Reduced Labor intensity--dark warehouse--robots are doing all the work, so who needs people
	Integrate warehouse information systems into logistics information systems
	Emphasis on "flexibility" to changing market conditions
Transportation
	in addition to inventory management and warehousing, ligistics is necessary to:
		Move goods from suppliers to buyers
		Move finished goods to the customer
	Products have little value to the customer until they are moved to the costomer's point of consumption
		Time utility - products are delivered at the right time. 
		Place utility - products are delivered to the desired location
	The objective of transportation management
		maximize value to firm through negotiation to provdie profit contribution
		make sure service is provided effectively
		satisfy customer needs
	Interface with supply chain
		transportation costs are affected by facility locations
		inventory requirements are invludenced by mode
		packaging requirements are dictated by mode
		materials handling equipment and loading dock design are dictated by mode
		customer service goals influence carrier choice
		strategic use of order-management technology can lead to maximium consolidation of loads to reduce transport costs
	Forms of transportation
		Common carriers
			offer shipping between locations at published rates without descrimination
		contract carriers
		exempt carriers
			exempt from regulation of services and rates if transporting certain products
		Private carrier
			not subject to economic regulation
			typically transports goods for the company owning the carrier
	Modes of transportation
		trucks
			small-ish vehicle size compared to other stuff
			Relatively high cost compared to rail and water, trade-off is faster service
			they go anywhere
			less than truckload and truck load carriers
			parcel carriers
				ups fedex usps
			truckload (TL) shipments are typically 10-42000 pounds
			500,000 registered trucking firms
		Trains
			Small number of carriers relative to trucking industry
			about 500 total
				class 1 railroads: 7 firms; 100,000 miles
				Regional Railroads 30 firms, 15000 miles
				shortline railroads: 300 firms, 20000 miles
				terminal railroads: 205 firms, 6000 miles
			long haul, large volume system
			accessibility can be a problem
			rail is about 40% of ton-miles but 10% of revenue
			very cheap
		air
			fast expensive
		domestic water
			freezes
		pipelines
			
			not suitable for general transportation
			high fixed cost
Transportation management activities and strategy
	negotiate rates and product classifications
	select carriers and routes
	contract for rates, service, and volume
	Freight/shipment consolidation - build density and volume to get lower prices from carriers
	Monitor service: not each load, but reviewing carrier performance
	optimize stuff
Carrier Reduction Strategy
	Advantages
		help carriers build lane density and achieve efficiencies
		carriers gain greater understanding of shippers' operations, proceses, and needs
		easier to manage fewer relationships
		reduced transaction costs
	Disadvantages
		risk associated with having too much business in hands of few carriers
		complacency may set in
Logistics for global markets
	it's more difficult when you cross borders
		ocean shipping
		
	Logistics intermediaries
		customs brokers
			deal with documentation mostly
		International or Foreign Freight Forwarders
		Trading companies
			network buyers and sellers from different countries
			often take title to the goods
		Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers
Foreign Trade Zones (tax dodge)
	Goods enter without customs formalities, duty or bond.
	Goods can be stored indefinitely and/or re-exported
	used for manufacturing
		import goods and components, asemble or manufacture, and ship o another country or then import to US
		importer pays duty only when the product reaches it's final destination
6 sigma tldr: Don't make a mistake

DPMO (defects per million opportunities)
	should be like 3 or some shit

	DMAIC Cycle
		developed by general Electric as a means of focussing effort on quality using methodological approach
	Types of variation:
		Assignable causes: factors that can be clearly identified and possibly managed. These can be eliminated
		Natural/common causes: inherent to the production process. In order to reduce variation due to common causes, the process must be changed
	tolerance limits Limits based on spec
	control limits based on performance
	statistics for the above stuff:
		R chart
		shows sample ranges over time of the variation of performance
	
	Lean Philosophy
		lean production seeks to eliminate waste in operations from 
		overproduction overhead
		waiting time
		transportation
		excess inventory
		over processing
		excess motion
		defects/rework
	The 5 Ss of Waste Reduction
	Sort(organize)
	Set in order(tidynes)
	Sweep(shine/purity: cleaning)
	Standardize(cleanliness -- simplify processes)
	Self-discipline(sustain/maintain)
Kanban
	pull production system
	visual control system
		composed of cards and containters
Continuous Improvement(Kaizen)
	continuous approach to reduce process, delivery, and quality prolems, such as machine breakdown problems, setup problems, and internal quality problems

Plan, Do, Check, Act
	make a plan to improve stuff
	execute the change
	study the results
	institutionalize the change or abandon it

Project Management
Project:
	Start to the work and a Stopping point to the work
Project Management: the management activities of a project

The Iron Triangle:
	a triangle with scope, cost and time on the corners
	quality is in the middle

	the tripple constraint in project management is the same sort of thing but it's 6 of em with schedule, resources, budget, quality, scope, and risk

	a functional project is housed wiht in a functional division
