Introduction to supply chain management
Companies produce goods and services
SILOS are when different parts of firms don't talk to each other

What is a Supply Chain? (see slides for all of these things)
A supply chain consists of hte flow of products, services, money, and information from:
	raw materials manufacturers
	Component an dintermediate manufacturers
	Final product manufacutrers
	Wholesalers and distributors and retailers
Connected by transportation and integrated through information, planning, and other ocordination activities.
((Customers))

Supply chain management can be defined a few different ways. 
The design and management of seamless, value-added process across organizational boundaries to meet the real needs of the end customer ~ institute for supply mainagement
managing supply and demand, sourcing raw materials and parts, manufacturing and assembly, warehousing and inventory tracking, order entry and order management, distribution across all channels, and delivery to the customer ~ the supply chain council
The planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities... also includes coordination with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers and customers. ~ council of supply chain management professionals

Pantene Shampoo (see slides)
They have a bunch of things up in the air they need to deal with

The book takes supply chain and splits it into the following
supply management + Operations Management + Logistics
get the bits + put em together + get em to the customers
integration combines all of the above. 

Additional foundations include supply elements;
	supplier management
		evaluation
		certification
	Strategic partnerships. 
Operations elements:
	Demand management
	MRP and ERP systems
	Lean systems
	Six Sigma
logistic elements:
	Transportation management
	warehouse management
	global logistics
Importance of Supply Chain Management
	Firms using supply chian management:
		start with key suppliers
		move on to other suppliers, customers, and shippers
		integrate second tier suppliers and customers
	Cost savings and better coordination of resources
		reduced bullwhip effect
Origins of Supply Chain Management
	1950s and 1960s
		US manufacutrers focused on mass production techniques as their principal cost reduction and productivitiy improvement strategies
		generally demand was greater than supply
	1960s and 1970s
		Introduction of new computer technlology lead to develpment of materials requirements plannign and manufacutrre resource planning to coodinate inventory management and improve internal communication
	80s and 90s
		Intense global competition led us manufacturers to adopt:
			supply Chain Management
			Just In Time
			Total quality management
			Buinsess Porcess Reengineering Practices
	2000s and beyond
		industrial buyers wil rely more on 3rd party logistics providers and shit dawg. 

Expanding the Supply Chain
	Firms are expanding partnerships and building facilitiees in foreign markets
	The expansion inviolves:
		breadth: foreign manufacutring, office, and retail site,s foreign duppliers and customers
		depth: second and thir dtier customers and suppliers
	Increasing supply chin responsiveness
		all sorts of crazy stuff they're trying to do. 
	The greening of supply chains
		Increasing the sustainability. 
A really brief history of purchasing
	Prominatory point: where railroads met 
Purchasing - key business function for acquiring materials, services and equipment
contracting - term often used for the acquisition of services
supply management - a newer term that encompasses all acquisition activities
Material Requisiton/Purchase Requesition ("req")
	states product, quanitty, and delivery date
	may originate as a planned order release from the MRP system
	traveling requisition used for recurring orders. 
Request for quotation/Proposal (RFQ/RFP
	Is the buyer's offer
Make or buy decision:
	Outsourcing
	Vertical integration
		backward
		forward
	Reasons for buying or outsourcing
		cost advantage (maybe)
		insufficient capacity
		lack of expertise
		quality
		strategic benefits of using best-in-class suppliers
		greater flexibility in the purchase of rapidly developing new technologies
		design cycle time reduction
		less captial is required -> risk transferred to the supplier
		technology
	Reasons for making
		Protect proprietary technology
		No component supplier
		Better quality control
		Use existing idle capacity
		Control of lead-time, transportatoin, and warehousing cost
		lower cost (per unit, usually)
	make vs buy analysis assumptions
		all costs can be classified as fixed or variabble
		fixed costs remain the same
		a lineral variable cost relationship exists
		the fixed cost of the make option is highter because of initial capital investment (equipment)
		variable cost of buy option is higher because of supplier profits

	Recent trends in supply chain management
		Outsourccing
		focusing of operations
		supply base reductoin
		long-term buyer supplier elationships
		partnerships rather than adversarial trading
	How many suppliers to use
		Reasons to have a single supplier
			to establish a relationship
			less quality variability
			lower cost
			transportation economies
			proprietary product or process
			volume too small to split
		reasons to have multiple suppliers
			need capacity
			spread risk of suppply interruption
			create competition
			information
			dealing with special kinds of business
	Total cost of ownership
Successful partnerships
	Achieve win-win
	require a strategic perspective and such
keys to succcessful partnerships
	building trust
	shared vision and objectives
	personal relationships
	mutual benefits and needs
	commitment and top management support
	Change Management
	Information sharing and lines of communicaiton
Challenges to managing relationships
	sharing information and maintaining confidentiality
	R & D and proprietary information
	satisfying customer expectations
	power in the chain
Vendor managed inventories
3rd party logistics services

Purchasing: Centralized vs decentralized
	Does headquarters get to make the decision or does the local office do it?

Forecasting: The forecast is always wrong
##extra credit##	4 points to tattoo "the forecast is always wrong" anywhere visible in busines clothing
Demand forecasting (guessing)
	estimate of future demand
	underlying basis of all business decisions
		production
		inventory
		personnel
		facilities
	Goal is to minimize forecast error
	math =/= Business
	
	Independent demand: finished goods
	dependent demand: raw materials, component parts, sub assemblies, etc.

	What can a firm do to manage an independent demand:
		Active role to influence demand
			pricing strategies
			advertising
		passive role and simply respond to demand
			adjusting capacity
	forecasting techniques
		qualitative: based on opinion and intuition
			generally used when data are limited, unavailable, or not currently relevant
		quantitative: uses mathematical models and historical data
			time series analysis
			causal relationships
			simulation
	Why?
		Average - average demand for a period of time
		trend - increasing or decreasing
		cyclical variations - wavelike movements that are longer than a year, usually due to the busines cycle
		seasonal element - peaks and valeys that repeat over a consistent interval
		random variation - due to unexpected or unpredictable events
	qualitative methods
		data unavailable, very limited, or not relevant

		jury of executive opinion
		sales force composite "how many do you think you're going to sell"
		customer surveys
		delphi method
			choose experts
			get forecasts from everyone
			summarize the results and redistribute them with new questions
			summarize again, refining forecasts and develop new quesitiosn
			rinse and repeat.

		Time series analysis
			take past history and use it to predict the future
			pick models based on 
				time horizon to forecast
				data availability
				accuracy required
				size of forecasting budget
				availability of qualitfied personnel
			Naive forecast
				take the previous period data and use the past period
	In this chapter we cover 3 basic methods:
		simple moving aveerage
			The average of however many periods in the past you want to look at. 
		weighted moving average
			same thing as above, but weigh the ones closer to now higher than the others. 
		exponential smoothing

		F_t+1 = \alphaA_t+(1-\alpha)F_t
		where f_t = forecast for period t
		f_t+1 = Forecast for period t+1
		A_t = Actual demand for period t
		\alpha = A smoothing constant

		or equivalently
		F_t+1 = F_t + \alpha(A_t - F_t)
		
		forecast tomorrow by taking today's forecast, and adjusting it by some amount (actual sales - forecast from today)*\alpha aka some constant
		
	forecast error
		What is the goal of a good forecast?
			minimize forecast error
			we need to measure the error in the forecast
			Consistency of error is also helpful
			error: error = actual-forecasted
			Running sum of forecast error
				idealy 0
		mean square error;
			take the average of the errors squared.
			it penalizes the frickfrack out of large errors
