Tips for negaitves

Evaluate your audience
	Understand not only the audience but also the nature of the message to deliver: the purpose, the information to include, the ways to build support, the objections your audience may have and how to answer those objections
Order the information
	As with any message, plan before drafting, using this order for the information:
		Give the reason before the refusal/negative statement when you have a reason that readers will understand and accept
		Give the negative infromationor refusal just once, clearly, compactly
		Bury the negative
			It may be cast a s a phrase instead of an entire sentence
			Place it in the middle of a paragraph
	Present an alternative, compromise, or benefit if available
	end with a positive, personal, forward-looking statement
Burying the negaitve
	remember to place the actual negative information within the sentence and/or paragraph
		in the middle of a sentence or etween sentences


Reasons 
Use reasons only if they would be accepeted by the reader
	make the reason for the negative clear and convincing
		if you do not have a good reason, omit the reason rather than use a weak one
		If you have several reasons, present only those which are strong
	Don't hide behind company policy. If possible, show readers how they will benefit from the policy; if they do not benefit, don't mention the policy at all
	Avoid saying you cannot do something
Refusals
	De-emphasize the refusal by putting it in the same paragraph as the reason
	Make certain the implication is clear: you are eliminating further correspondence on the issue
Alternatives
	Use an alternaitve if one is available
		Offer the readers another way to get what they want
		suggest you care baout their needs
		enable the readers to reestablsih their own ego when you set limits on their freedom by saying no
		allow you to end on a positive note and presents you and your company in a positive light
Recast messages
