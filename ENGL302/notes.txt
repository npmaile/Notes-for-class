What is You attitude?

It allows you to be a better writer

talk about the audience not yourself
refer to audiences request or order
don't talk about feelings

Use inclusive we. If we doesn't include the audience, it will alienate
In negative situations, avoid "you"

Audiences may not understand why a message has arrived or what it means to them. 
Tell how message affects the audience
don't mention communicators work or generosity
stress what the audience wants to know

focus on what the readers can do, get or what they are recieving. 

Examples:
in positive situations use "you"
bad
We now give you 20% back on purchases
good
you can now get 20% back on purchases
