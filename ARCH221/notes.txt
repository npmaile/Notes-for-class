Prehistoric Architecture as a second nature... caves and huts
The difference between building and architecture: thought and design

see Lecture 2 slide 1: 
	The adobe building is good design and functional architecture for quite a few reasons. 	
		Built sustainably into the mountain with the overhang and the back wall. 
		Has windows, walls, changing levels and other useful design elements
		Built from adobe
			has good insulating properties.
Prehistoric architecture is all based on what's still around. 
Writing didn't really exist until 3500 BCE
there was proto-writing around 6000 BCE
No year 0 btw the years start at 1 CE

The periods of prehistory are subdivided by the tools used (see Lecture 2 handout)
