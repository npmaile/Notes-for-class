Philosophy: What is it?
Axiology: the study of value
Epistemology: the study of knowledge
	greek word epistemos means knowledge (hereinmygarage.avi)
Metaphysics: "not an ology" the study of the nature of reality
	meta just means after. based on the placement of books in a library
	not astrology
Justification = a reason that succeeds in supporting a claim
when a todler keeps asking why, how do you stop them?
	ad baculum--appeal to the stick-- (beat them)
	change the subject (distract them)
	shift the burden (ask them "why not")
	insist (because I said so)
	appeal to other authorities (because mom says so)
	ENGAGE WITH THE QUESTION:
	no answer ( implies: you don't know)
	each time you provide an answer, questioner asks "why?"
The problem of justification
	1. in order for a judgement ot count as knowledge, there must be evidence to support it
	2. that evidence must be justified
	3. but that justification is new evidence, which must be justified also.
	4. and so on
	Therefore, knowledge is impossible because it requires an infinite chain of justification which is impossible to have. 
skepticisim = the view we cannot have knowledge about some (or every) doman of inquiry
The nagging todler is now known as a skeptic

Argument: one or more statements that are connected together in order toprove or make probable the truth of another statement
Premise: hte statements that provide support or evidence
conclusion: the statement that is (supposed to be) supported or proven by the premises. 
Strategies for attacking an argument:
	Show that one or more of the premises is false
	show that even if the premises were true, they would not by themselves establish the conclusion. 
Responses to the problem of justification:
	accept the argument:
		complete sketicism
	Premise #3 about arguing is wrong: the evidence doesn't necessarily need to be ""new"" 
		foundationalism: some evidence is foundational
		Coherentism: Different judgements may justify each other
The argument presupposes that the knower is able to supply the justification but all that is required is that the knower be justified
	externalism about justificaiton
		e.g., Reliabilism: so ong as the judgement is formed by a reliable process (whether or not the knower knows this), it is justified. 
Foundationalism:
	the view that any judgement that counts a knowledge is eighter:
		1. foundational
			for descartes, foundational judgements are self evident or
		2. inferred from some other judgements that counts as knowledge
	inferential judgement:
		a judgement that depends on some other judgement for its evidence and justification
	self-evident judgement:
		a judgement that provides its own evidence and justification
	Descarte's Criterion for Self eviden tknowledge:
		absolutely certain
			Same as psychological conviction?
				No, Because I could be mistaken
			indubitable (unable to be doubted)
			impossible to be mistaken
		Descarte's test to dertermine whether a judgement is not self-evident
			if there is any possible scenario in which my judgement (made on the basis of partiular evidence) would fail to meet the criterion for self-evident knowledge, then my judgement is not self-evident knowledge
		Probable: likely to happen
		possibel: could be (even if very unlikely)
			tomorrow eill be hot.
			A singkhole will swallow Pearson Hall tonight
		logical possibility: conceivable without contradiction
			Jones's biological mother has no biological children
			I hold my breath for 24 hours straight. 
			one of the above ^^ is not logicaly possible, while the other is possible. 
Is there a test that I can perform right now that would prove that I am not asleep right now?
			That is, we can fill in the folowing blank:
				No dreams could have this feature:
		Dream Argument
			right now, I am unable to determine with absolute certainty that I am not asleep.

			Therefore, a judgement is not self-evident if it depends upon my being aboslutely certain that I am not asleep when making it. 
	Appearance vs. Reality
	Different types of judgements;
		sensory judgements: format: judgement, evidence
			I judge that there really exists a hand, 
			simply because it appears to my senses that there is a hand
			
			Not foundational because they are all based in sensory knowledge
		Judgements from Testimony:
			I judge that there is a quiz today, simply because the agenda says that there is a quiz today
