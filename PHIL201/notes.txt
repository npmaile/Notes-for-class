Philosophy: What is it?
Axiology: the study of value
Epistemology: the study of knowledge
	greek word epistemos means knowledge (hereinmygarage.avi)
Metaphysics: "not an ology" the study of the nature of reality
	meta just means after. based on the placement of books in a library
	not astrology
Justification = a reason that succeeds in supporting a claim
when a todler keeps asking why, how do you stop them?
	ad baculum--appeal to the stick-- (beat them)
	change the subject (distract them)
	shift the burden (ask them "why not")
	insist (because I said so)
	appeal to other authorities (because mom says so)
	ENGAGE WITH THE QUESTION:
	no answer ( implies: you don't know)
	each time you provide an answer, questioner asks "why?"
The problem of justification
	1. in order for a judgement ot count as knowledge, there must be evidence to support it
	2. that evidence must be justified
	3. but that justification is new evidence, which must be justified also.
	4. and so on
	Therefore, knowledge is impossible because it requires an infinite chain of justification which is impossible to have. 
skepticisim = the view we cannot have knowledge about some (or every) doman of inquiry
The nagging todler is now known as a skeptic

Argument: one or more statements that are connected together in order toprove or make probable the truth of another statement
Premise: hte statements that provide support or evidence
conclusion: the statement that is (supposed to be) supported or proven by the premises.
