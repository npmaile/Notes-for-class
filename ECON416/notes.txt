What the h*ck is "industrial Organization"
study markets and industries, especially how firms compete
	--comes from microeconomics, focus on imperfectly competitive markets
critical concept: market power
	the ability to set prices above marginal costs
Industrial Organization "questions"
	Is there market power?
		Market power = ability to set prices above costs
		non--trivial mpirical question
		chicago school: as long as there is free entry, market power is not significan
	How do firms acquire and maintain market power?
		Legal protection from competition
		firms strategies matter
	What are the implications of market power?
		transfer wealth from consumers to firms
		inefficient allocation of resources
		rent seeking behavior
		impacts on innovation and technical progress
	Is there a role for public policy to address market power?
		Antitrus(competition policy) -- Sherman Act (1890) and Clayton Act(1914)
			Prohibits collusion among rivals, explicit cartels and price fixing arrangements
		DOJ and FTC may review and oppose mergers and acquisitions
		Regiulation
	-antitrust and regulation
Framework of analysis
	study of industrial organization will focus on the competition between firms
		need to look at the strategic ehavior of firma snd the sturcture of the market in which they compete
	firms are treated as single decision makers that maximize profits
		natural and common assumption
		focus mostly on the competition between firms, will neglect internal organization issues
	markets are analyzed in a partial equilibrium(PE) setting
		PE means that we will look at firms' interactions within a single market
		The PE framework permits a tractable meaningful welfare (normative) analysis

Basic reveiw of microeconomic principles
Demand
	the ultimate source of demand is customer's uying behavior
	Economic theory explains the nature of demand in terms of two building blocks
		consumer's tastes and preferences(indiference curves)
		consumer's budget constraint (determined by own income and market prices)
		Demand functions: quantitiy demanded of any one good depends on all prices and income	
	textbook (page 16)
	Because most of our analysis is done in a partial equilibrium setting, we can hold fixed income and all prices except the price of the good of interest ->demand curves
	The demand curve is written as D(p) to indicate that how much of a given good/service is purchased by consumers depends on its price p
		higher price-> lower quantity: the demand curve is downward sloping, (dD(p)/dp)<0
	An alternative, fully equivalent representation is the inverse demand curve
			Demand curves slope down-- use calculus fam
		the inverse demand curve p(Q) gives the market price for a given aggregate output Q	
		it represents the consumers' (marginal) willingness to pay
		of course, the inverse demand curve is also downward sloping: (dp(Q)/dQ)<0
	a linear demand function can be written as D(p) = a-bp
	the corresponding inverse demand function is p(Q) = \lambda - \beta *Q, where \lambda = a/b and \beta = 1/b
	note that (dD(p)/dp)=-b and (dp(Q)/dQ) = - \beta
Demand Elasticity
	measures the responsiveness of demand D(p) to changes in price
	definition	elasticity = (dD(p)/dp)*(p/D(p)) = ((\delta* D)/(\delta*p))* (p/D) = (\delta*D/D)/(\delta*p/p) = (%\delta*D)/(%\delta*p))
	relative change in one over relative change in another
	if elasticity is greater than 1, demand is elastic if elasticity is less than one the demand is inelastic. This depends on substitutes
	the elasticity of demand determines how revenue R is affected by a price change because R=pQ and Q=D(p), then
((dR)/(dp))=P((dD(p))/dp)+D(p) = (1+elasticity)D(p)

welfare
	to discuss the welfare iimplications of market outcomes we need to measure how consumers and producers value such outcomes in monetary terms
	Consumer surplus: Area below the demand curve and above the price line
	the demand curve displaysthe consumers' willingness to pay for each unit
	the cost of goods to consumers is their marginal willingness to pay, and thus they enjoy a "surplus" of benefits for all consumed units(except the last one)
profit = Revenue-Cost, or \pi = pq -C(q) where C(q) is the "cost function"
Cost functions reflect the specific production processes that are carried out by the firm
	We write C(q) to indicate that total cost depends on the amount q that is produced
		it costs more to produce a larger q
	The actual shape of C(q) depends on the technology of the firm (production function)
Profit maximization requires cost minimization
	to maximize profit, costs must be kept as low as possible for a given output
		the fim achieves "production efficiency"
A profit maximizing firm ALWAYS minimises costs
The cost function C(q) is a succinct summary of production conditions for efficient firms
Types of costs
	Fixed costs (F):expense that does not depend on how many output units are produced
		example a car for a taxicab
		Fixed costs can be either sunk or avoidable costs
			sunk have already been paid
			avoidable are yet to be paid
	Variable costs(VC): expense that depends on output level (example: fuel for a taxicab)
Total costs C=F+VC
	Total cost depends on the amount of output produced (and, also, on input prices...)
	if q denotes the level of output, then the cost functions is C(q=F+VC(q)
	C(q) tells us the total $ cost of all of the inputs required to produce q units of output
Average costs (per unit costs)
Average Fixed cost: AFC(q) = F/q
Average Variable Cost: AVC(q) = VC(q)/q
Average total cost: AC(q)= AFC(q)+AVC(q)
Marginal cost(cost of an additional unit): MC(q) = dC(q)/dq

Cost functions are often assumed to have "U-shaped" average costs
	that may be plausible in many situations, but not always appropriate
	Actual shape of cost curves depends on the technology of the firm(production function)
Opportunity cost = value of the best foregone alternative
	note the difference between "accounting" costs and "economic" costs
entry/exit decisions: When all factors of production are valued at their opportunity costs, then, as long as the resulting profit is non-negative, the firm should continue to stay in business
	this is the best way to understand the"zero profit" condition of competitive equilibrium
	-all inputs are being rewarded as much as their best possible use...
	note: a "sunk cost" is an asset which has zero opportunity cost
zero profits is not an accounting issue, but an economic issue
	understanding costs: Economic vs accounting
	expensing: costs are counted when they are incurred
	amortizing: costs spread over the useful life of the input (depreciation)
	
	Whether a cost is "sunk" or "avoidable" depends on the relevant time frame
		Short run: time frame such that some factors of production cannot be changed
		Long run: all facctors of production can be varied as desired fixed costs are avoidabe (never sunk) 
In the long run, we are all dead.

Economies of scale
if AC does not change as q increases, then: Constant Retuns to Scale (RTS)
if AC decreases as q increases, then: Economies of Scale (increasing RTS)
if AC Increases as q increases, then: Diseconomies of Scale (decreasing RTS)
	note the common U-shaped cost structures display all three cases of RTS
Most efficient scale: Level of output at which the minimum AC is attained
	Can help explain why some industries might be more concentrated than others
The concept of the firm
	"read the book"
Perfect competition
Large number of buysers and sellers
	everyone is aprice taker
Homogeneous product
	consumers view the product of different firms as perfect substitutes
Perfect information
	Everyone knows about prices and product attributes
Costless entry/exit
	no transaction costs to participate in the market
	free access to technology
Most real world markets are not perfectly competitive

How do firms behave when they are price takers
	Objective: profit maximization-- choose output level q to maximize \pi = pq-C(q)

Optimality condition: choose q* such that p=(dC(q*)/dq) aka p=MC(q*)
provided that \pi*=pq*-C(q*)>=0		aka p>=AC(q*)
ie marginal cost = price and profit is nonnegative

For any given price p each firm solves MC=p -> firm's optimal quantity supplied q*
	When price changes, profit maximizing competitive firms change their optimal supply
Industry supply S(p) tells us the amount produced by the totality of all firms operating in an industry
in the short run the number of firms is fixed, say = n (no entryof new firms)
	because the number of firms is fixed, industry supploy S(p) is simply equal to nq*
	when price changes, firms' output change, hence industry supply also changes
	if there are no fixed costs, in the short run these costs are assumed to be sunk

in the long run the number of firms n operating in an industry can change (entry of new firms and/or exit of existing firms are both possible)
	because the number of firms to n* is determined by equilibrium, industry supply S(p) is equal to n*q*
	if there are fixed costs, in the long run they are assumed to be avoidable
Competitive equilibrium in the short run - firms and industry
Equilibrium = total demand equals total supply S(p*)=D(p*)
	here, the firms' optimal desisions are subsumed intot hte supply function S(p*)
Alternatively: because the number n of identical firms is fixed in teh short run, equilibrium requires
	MC(q*)=p* , that is, each firm is choosing the profit maximizing output level
	nq*=D(p*) , that is, the market clears (industry supply = market demand)
	note: these two condidtions define a two-equation system that solves for two equilibrium variables:
		The market price p* and firm output q* (industry output is simply Q*=nq*

Comparative statics
see figure 4.3 in textbook p. 72

Competitive equilibrium - Long run
In the long run there is freedom of entry or exit such that the number of firms is not fixed - instead, n* is determined by the equilibrium conditions
	new firms will enter the marke tif positive profit can be made and existing firms can exit if profit were negative
	firms produce at their "most efficient scale" i.e. where AC is minimized
if the market demand function is D(p) and all firms are identical, the three equilibrium conditions are:
	MC(q*)=p*: firms are choosing the profit maximizing output level
	p*=AC(q*): firms make zero profit
	n*q*=D(p*): the market clears (market supply = market demand)
