What the h*ck is "industrial Organization"
study markets and industries, especially how firms compete
	--comes from microeconomics, focus on imperfectly competitive markets
critical concept: market power
	the ability to set prices above marginal costs
Industrial Organization "questions"
	Is there market power?
		Market power = ability to set prices above costs
		non--trivial mpirical question
		chicago school: as long as there is free entry, market power is not significan
	How do firms acquire and maintain market power?
		Legal protection from competition
		firms strategies matter
	What are the implications of market power?
		transfer wealth from consumers to firms
		inefficient allocation of resources
		rent seeking behavior
		impacts on innovation and technical progress
	Is there a role for public policy to address market power?
		Antitrus(competition policy) -- Sherman Act (1890) and Clayton Act(1914)
			Prohibits collusion among rivals, explicit cartels and price fixing arrangements
		DOJ and FTC may review and oppose mergers and acquisitions
		Regiulation
	-antitrust and regulation
Framework of analysis
	study of industrial organization will focus on the competition between firms
		need to look at the strategic ehavior of firma snd the sturcture of the market in which they compete
	firms are treated as single decision makers that maximize profits
		natural and common assumption
		focus mostly on the competition between firms, will neglect internal organization issues
	markets are analyzed in a partial equilibrium(PE) setting
		PE means that we will look at firms' interactions within a single market
		The PE framework permits a tractable meaningful welfare (normative) analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic reveiw of microeconomic principles
Demand
	the ultimate source of demand is customer's uying behavior
	Economic theory explains the nature of demand in terms of two building blocks
		consumer's tastes and preferences(indiference curves)
		consumer's budget constraint (determined by own income and market prices)
		Demand functions: quantitiy demanded of any one good depends on all prices and income	
	textbook (page 16)
	Because most of our analysis is done in a partial equilibrium setting, we can hold fixed income and all prices except the price of the good of interest ->demand curves
	The demand curve is written as D(p) to indicate that how much of a given good/service is purchased by consumers depends on its price p
		higher price-> lower quantity: the demand curve is downward sloping, (dD(p)/dp)<0
	An alternative, fully equivalent representation is the inverse demand curve
			Demand curves slope down-- use calculus fam
		the inverse demand curve p(Q) gives the market price for a given aggregate output Q	
		it represents the consumers' (marginal) willingness to pay
		of course, the inverse demand curve is also downward sloping: (dp(Q)/dQ)<0
	a linear demand function can be written as D(p) = a-bp
	the corresponding inverse demand function is p(Q) = \lambda - \beta *Q, where \lambda = a/b and \beta = 1/b
	note that (dD(p)/dp)=-b and (dp(Q)/dQ) = - \beta
Demand Elasticity
	measures the responsiveness of demand D(p) to changes in price
	definition	elasticity = (dD(p)/dp)*(p/D(p)) = ((\delta* D)/(\delta*p))* (p/D) = (\delta*D/D)/(\delta*p/p) = (%\delta*D)/(%\delta*p))
	relative change in one over relative change in another
	if elasticity is greater than 1, demand is elastic if elasticity is less than one the demand is inelastic. This depends on substitutes
	the elasticity of demand determines how revenue R is affected by a price change because R=pQ and Q=D(p), then
((dR)/(dp))=P((dD(p))/dp)+D(p) = (1+elasticity)D(p)

welfare
	to discuss the welfare iimplications of market outcomes we need to measure how consumers and producers value such outcomes in monetary terms
	Consumer surplus: Area below the demand curve and above the price line
	the demand curve displaysthe consumers' willingness to pay for each unit
	the cost of goods to consumers is their marginal willingness to pay, and thus they enjoy a "surplus" of benefits for all consumed units(except the last one)
profit = Revenue-Cost, or \pi = pq -C(q) where C(q) is the "cost function"
Cost functions reflect the specific production processes that are carried out by the firm
	We write C(q) to indicate that total cost depends on the amount q that is produced
		it costs more to produce a larger q
	The actual shape of C(q) depends on the technology of the firm (production function)
Profit maximization requires cost minimization
	to maximize profit, costs must be kept as low as possible for a given output
		the fim achieves "production efficiency"
A profit maximizing firm ALWAYS minimises costs
The cost function C(q) is a succinct summary of production conditions for efficient firms
Types of costs
	Fixed costs (F):expense that does not depend on how many output units are produced
		example a car for a taxicab
		Fixed costs can be either sunk or avoidable costs
			sunk have already been paid
			avoidable are yet to be paid
	Variable costs(VC): expense that depends on output level (example: fuel for a taxicab)
Total costs C=F+VC
	Total cost depends on the amount of output produced (and, also, on input prices...)
	if q denotes the level of output, then the cost functions is C(q=F+VC(q)
	C(q) tells us the total $ cost of all of the inputs required to produce q units of output
Average costs (per unit costs)
Average Fixed cost: AFC(q) = F/q
Average Variable Cost: AVC(q) = VC(q)/q
Average total cost: AC(q)= AFC(q)+AVC(q)
Marginal cost(cost of an additional unit): MC(q) = dC(q)/dq

Cost functions are often assumed to have "U-shaped" average costs
	that may be plausible in many situations, but not always appropriate
	Actual shape of cost curves depends on the technology of the firm(production function)
Opportunity cost = value of the best foregone alternative
	note the difference between "accounting" costs and "economic" costs
entry/exit decisions: When all factors of production are valued at their opportunity costs, then, as long as the resulting profit is non-negative, the firm should continue to stay in business
	this is the best way to understand the"zero profit" condition of competitive equilibrium
	-all inputs are being rewarded as much as their best possible use...
	note: a "sunk cost" is an asset which has zero opportunity cost
zero profits is not an accounting issue, but an economic issue
	understanding costs: Economic vs accounting
	expensing: costs are counted when they are incurred
	amortizing: costs spread over the useful life of the input (depreciation)
	
	Whether a cost is "sunk" or "avoidable" depends on the relevant time frame
		Short run: time frame such that some factors of production cannot be changed
		Long run: all facctors of production can be varied as desired fixed costs are avoidabe (never sunk) 
In the long run, we are all dead.

Economies of scale
if AC does not change as q increases, then: Constant Retuns to Scale (RTS)
if AC decreases as q increases, then: Economies of Scale (increasing RTS)
if AC Increases as q increases, then: Diseconomies of Scale (decreasing RTS)
	note the common U-shaped cost structures display all three cases of RTS
Most efficient scale: Level of output at which the minimum AC is attained
	Can help explain why some industries might be more concentrated than others
The concept of the firm
	"read the book"
Perfect competition
Large number of buysers and sellers
	everyone is aprice taker
Homogeneous product
	consumers view the product of different firms as perfect substitutes
Perfect information
	Everyone knows about prices and product attributes
Costless entry/exit
	no transaction costs to participate in the market
	free access to technology
Most real world markets are not perfectly competitive

How do firms behave when they are price takers
	Objective: profit maximization-- choose output level q to maximize \pi = pq-C(q)

Optimality condition: choose q* such that p=(dC(q*)/dq) aka p=MC(q*)
provided that \pi*=pq*-C(q*)>=0		aka p>=AC(q*)
ie marginal cost = price and profit is nonnegative

For any given price p each firm solves MC=p -> firm's optimal quantity supplied q*
	When price changes, profit maximizing competitive firms change their optimal supply
Industry supply S(p) tells us the amount produced by the totality of all firms operating in an industry
in the short run the number of firms is fixed, say = n (no entryof new firms)
	because the number of firms is fixed, industry supploy S(p) is simply equal to nq*
	when price changes, firms' output change, hence industry supply also changes
	if there are no fixed costs, in the short run these costs are assumed to be sunk

in the long run the number of firms n operating in an industry can change (entry of new firms and/or exit of existing firms are both possible)
	because the number of firms to n* is determined by equilibrium, industry supply S(p) is equal to n*q*
	if there are fixed costs, in the long run they are assumed to be avoidable
Competitive equilibrium in the short run - firms and industry
Equilibrium = total demand equals total supply S(p*)=D(p*)
	here, the firms' optimal desisions are subsumed intot hte supply function S(p*)
Alternatively: because the number n of identical firms is fixed in teh short run, equilibrium requires
	MC(q*)=p* , that is, each firm is choosing the profit maximizing output level
	nq*=D(p*) , that is, the market clears (industry supply = market demand)
	note: these two condidtions define a two-equation system that solves for two equilibrium variables:
		The market price p* and firm output q* (industry output is simply Q*=nq*

Comparative statics
see figure 4.3 in textbook p. 72

Competitive equilibrium - Long run
In the long run there is freedom of entry or exit such that the number of firms is not fixed - instead, n* is determined by the equilibrium conditions
	new firms will enter the marke tif positive profit can be made and existing firms can exit if profit were negative
	firms produce at their "most efficient scale" i.e. where AC is minimized
if the market demand function is D(p) and all firms are identical, the three equilibrium conditions are:
	MC(q*)=p*: firms are choosing the profit maximizing output level
	p*=AC(q*): firms make zero profit
	n*q*=D(p*): the market clears (market supply = market demand)

We measure welfare as the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus
Consumer surplus: area below the demand curve and above the price line
	the demand curve displays customers' willingness to pay for each unit
	the cost of goods to consumers is their marginal willingness to pay and thus they enjoy a "surplus" of benefits for all consumed units (except the last one)

Producer surplus: area above the supply curve and below the price line
	the supply curve is a marginal cost curve and, if it is increasing, ithe firm gets paid the maximum marginal cost of the last unit for all units
	producer surplus is essentially a measure of (variable)profit
profit = producer surplus assuming fixed costs are sunk
when fixed costs aren't sunk, it's exactly the same situation, but shifted up by the price of the fixed costs

the fundamental theorem - the competitive equilibrium is efficient
There are two (static) efficiency concepts: production efficiency and allocative efficiency
	production efficiency: output is produced at minimum cost
	allocative efficiency: the "correct" amount of output is produced

Competitive equilibrium obviously satisfies production efficiency because
	to maximize profit, firms must be minimizing cost regardless of ow much they produce also if there were inefficient firms, they would be squeezed out of the market
Competitive equilibrium also satisfies allocative efficiency because
	the marginal value that consumers put on the good produced in the industry is equal to the marginal cost of producing it
Alternative statement of allocative efficiency: the competitive equilibrium maximizes the sum of producer surplus and consumer surplus
When the oncidtions for a competitive equilibrium are violated there is a welfare leoss, which is measured by the deadweight loss of consumer and producer surplus 
	

Non-competitive markets: an example
Turing pharmaceuticals and Daraprim
	Martin shkreli
firms that operate in markets without competitors can behave as monopolies
	eqilibrium with a monopoly differs from competitive markets
A firm is a monopoly if it is the sole supplier of a product for which there are no close substitutes (-> the demand curve facing the monopolistic firm is downward-sloping)
A monopoly is constrained by market demand
	if it sets the price then consumers will chose how much to buy 
	if it chooses the quantity to sell, consumer demand will determine the price

Thus, there are two equivalent ways of representing profit maximization for the monopolist:
	Price-setting: choose price p to maximize profit subject to the demand function D(p)
		maximize \pi=p*D(p)-C(D(p))
	Quantity setting: Choose quantity q to maximize profit subject to the inverse demand function p(Q)
		Maximize \pi=p(Q)*Q-C(Q)
Optimality condition for monopolist: MR = MC
Optimality condition(from quantity-setting problem):
	Marginal revenue = Marginal cost

At the margin, the monopolist's choice to sell one more unit of output has two effects:
	It increases total cost (by the MC)
	It decreases the price that the monopolist can cahrge(for all untis!)
		The MR created by the last units is thus lower than the price charged
Note: because dp(Q*)/dQ<0(i.e., demand slopes down), the monopolist charges a price p(Q*) that is higher than the marginal cost(i.e, it chooses to produce less that that the output level of equilibrium)

e ((dp(Q))/dQ)*(Q)/(p(Q))=1/\lowerepsilon , the monopolist MR can be expressed as MR=p(Q)(1+(1/\lowerepsilon)
	the optimization rule MR=MC implies: (p-MC)/p*)=1/-\lowersigma or p*=(\lowersigma/(1+\lowersigma))*MC 

This is the inverse elasticity rule, which says that the monopolists markup of price over mc is inversely related to the elasticity of demand (less elastic deman means higher price

the margin (p-MC)/p is called the "lerner index" of market power (note that this index becomesequal to zero under competitive pricing p = MC

Clearly, the learner index cannot be negative, and this implies that at the monopolist's profit maximizing solution demand must be elastic (that is, |\epsilon| >1

A monopoly raises the price above marginal cost and restricts the amount of googd sold to consumers, and this creates a loss of social welfare
	Because a monopolit's maximizes profit, it satisfies the "production efficiency" notion (it produces its chosen output level at the minimum possible cost)
But: because a monopolist chooses a level of output that is too small relative to what is socially desirable, "allocative efficiency" is not satisfied
	at Q* the consumers' marginal willingness to pay is higher than the MC of production
	from society's perspective, the optimal quantity if the competitive level Q^0 (and Q^0 > Q*)
(P^m -c)/P^m  Lerner Index
the Deadweight loss due to monopoly can be computed as the change in the sum of consumer and producer surplus - see illustrations

The deadweight welfare loss of monopoly is larger the more inelastic the market demand. 

How does a firm become a monopoly
Knowledge advantage
	a firm possesses a superior production technique -- lower costs
	a firm has exclusive access to technology for a new product
		-intellectual property rights: patents, copywrights
ncreasing returns to scale
	for example, large fixed costs (common for the case of utilities)
	case of the so-called natural monopoly: AC falling at all output level
Mergers/cartels

network effects
	facebook
"monopolist" is the only supplier in a market... what does it really mean?
	role of demand and problem of market definition
		"every frim is a monopoly in the sense that they are the only one selling the specific bit"

Public policies for market power
Market power as parcticed by a monopoly leads to a welfare loss
	monopoly leads to allocative inefficiency
There are two general families of policy instruments to deal with the implications of market power
	competition policy (in the US, typically referred to as antitrust)
		antitrust measures are meant to foster and/or restore competition
		Main areas of application include price fixing/cartels, mergers, and abuse of dominant positions
	Regulation
		useful when the root of market power is in the existence of large fixed costs (natural monoploy case)
		Includes price caps and rate-of-return regulations
Antitrust laws limit the exercise of market power by firms and contorl how firms compete
	monopolies are not illegal, but certain actions to acquire and maintain monopoly power are forbiddent
U.S. antitrust statutes originated with the sherman act (1890)
	section 1 prohibits contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade
		prohiits collusion among rivals and explicit cartels; price fixing arrangement are per se illegal
	Section 2 prohibits monopolization or attempts to monopolize a market
		courts' interpretation: it is not a crime to be a monopoly as long as the monopoly does not commit bad acts -> the rule of reason approach
		forbids firms' exclusionary conducts (bad acts) that adversely affect competition; such cases involve predatory priicng, denying key product to rivals, vertical relationships and tie-in sales

Clayton act (1914)
	section 2 prohibits price discrimination
	section 3 prohibitss exclusive dealing and tie in sales if they lessen competition
	section 7 limits mergers that reduce competition
	injured parties can get treble damages
Federal trade commission act extablishes the FTC to stop that stuff

Regulating monopolies
-------------------------------------------------
force the monopolist ot price at marginal cost if MC = c, then p^R = c
	potential problems:
	if there are large fixed costs, the monopoly would make negative profit
	how does the regulator know the marginal cost of production
Force the monopolist to price at average cost
	example: rate-of-return regulation, which choses price p^R so as to allow the monopoly to earn a fair rate of return on capital investments
		may lead to over investment in capital relative to other factors
		does not provide regulated firm with enough incentives for R&D investment to reduce costs (i.e., it may affect the dynamic efficiency of the firm)
 cap regulation
	again, it may affect the dynamic efficiency of the firm
	there is a subtle regulator's commitment problem
Natural monopoly
a natural monopoly can arise in a market where all potential firms face Scale Economies (ie increasing returns to scale) as for example if the cist function is C(Q) = F + cQ
	in such a case, only one firm may emerge from market competition
	this can also be efficient from society's point of view (the fixed costs F need to be incurred only once). But, because unrestricted monopoly leads to welfare loss, a commonly-invoked policy is to regulate the monopoly
	regulation can take the form of a ceiling on the price the monopoly can charge
		if the maximimum price allowed is equal to average cost ac, the monopoly can break even 
		for regulated utiilities, this average cost pricing can take the form of so-called rate-of-return-regulation
C(sub)d= dominant firm's marginal cost
c(sub)F= marginal cost of firms in the competitive fringe( as noted, typically c(sub)F>c(sub)D)
 Discrimination refers to the practice of charging different prices to different customers for essentially the same product, or charging a single customer a price that varies depending on how many untis the customer buys

Some veveryday examples of "price discrimination"
	quantity discounts: pay les per unit if you buy more
		foot long or 6" sandwich at subway
		gallon of milk vs quart of milk
	flat fee for unlimited quanitites
	medical doctors fees discounts to hmos
	senior discounts, student discounts
	price reductions with "coupons"
	matinee prices at the movie theater
	time of day pricing
	business class and econonomy class airline prices
Price discrimination is a feature of non-competitive markets
	in competitive markets, because of arbitrage, the law of one price typically prevails
	an element that ensures arbitrage is the possibility of resale. For price discrimination to be feasible, it must be that resale is not possibe. This might happen because
		transaction costs for buying and selling are too hgh for an individual
		resale may be illegal
not all price differences are due to price discrimination
	Price differences that reflect variations in product characteristics... he moved to the next slide too fast
Price discriminaiton, if it is feasable, can increase a monopolist's profits
Think of a monopoly that charges a uniform price by the standard rule MR = MC

Conditions for successful price discrimination
	A firm must have some market power ( ability to set p> MC)
	Ther frim must be able to identify whom to charge the higher price
	a firm must be able to prevent or limit resale
Types of Price Discrimination
	perfect price discrimination first degree
		each firm sells each unit at the maximum willingness to pay 
	Selection by indicators practice of market segmentation third degree
		profit is the revenue in each market added together minus the total cost
		Sell to two markets at different prices 
	Self selection: when buyers characterize whatever
Market segmentation and the elasticity rule
	The pirce is higher in the market with more inelastic demand and lower in the market with more elastic demand
	because the monopoly treats the two markets as separate, the inverse elasticity rule applies separately to each market
Perfect price descrimination
	assume everyone buys 0 or 1 of the product
	everyone has a different demand curve
	charge exactly along the demand curve
	How the h*ck do you do this?
		Two-part tariff
			Asked to pay price p for a unit and a fixed fee independent of how many units the consumer buys
			The consumer wants to get their value out of the fixed fee

Another way to perfect price discrimination: Take-it-or-leave-it offers
	with a two part tariff, the monopolist optimally sets the price p and the fixed fee f and lets the consumer pick the quantity he/she wants
	alternatively, the monopolist can offer one choice to the customer: buy quantity q and pay the toatal amount or buy nothing. the consumer will accept if the net surplus is non-negative
	This take it or leave it strategy can produce the same outcome as the two part tariff
	Suppose that a monopolist has two types of buyers, who can be clearly identified, that differ in terms of their demand. Then the monopolist can practice perfect price discrimination by offering to each buyer the exact quantity that htis customer would want to buy if the good was competitively priced, and charging the consumer the total surplus

	In many markets consumers differ in their taste for a particular good and or in their income level, but the seller does not have enough information to tell consumers apart and it cannot force a different price scheme on different consumers

	in such cases, second degree price discrimination can help the seller; by offer a menu of choices
	The same menu is available to all consumers, but because consumers are different they will make different choices

Oligopoly

Oligopoly is a market with a small number of firms
	this is an attracitve feature when analyzing real-world markets
		contrast with: Perfrect competition (many firms) and monopoly
	Main point: in an oligoopoly setting, firms cannot ignore the actions of other firms
		This is unlike what happens in monopoly and competitive markets. 
	Standard oligopoly model
		consumers are price takers
		firms produce a homogeneous product
		there are only a few firms and the number is fixed (no entry)
		Critical question: what can firms choose(strategic variables)
			firms choose their own output level(cournot model)
			firms choose the posted price they charge for their product(bertrand model)
	The analysis of oligopoly models depends critically ont he use of game theory

GAME THEORY
	geme theory deals with the interactin decision making of rational individuals
		main feature: the return to an individual depends not only on his/her choice but also on the choices of all other participants(strategic interaction)
	a (normal form) game consists of hte following elements:
		the set of(two or more) players
		for each player, the set of actions that they can choose form
		individual payoffs (as a function of the acitons taken y all playrs

	prisoner's delimma (i'm not taking notes for this bit)

Simple Cournot duopoly game
	a cournot oligoopoly is a model in which firms choose their quantity level, simultaneously and independently of the other firm
	a duopoly is an oligopoly with only two firms
	the prisoner's dilemma works the same way with firms that choose quantity level


Nash equilibrium identifies the action profile such that all players are playing a best response to the action of other players-- no player has a unilateral incentive to choose a different action

Illustration: Cournot" duopoly(two firms and they compete by coosing their quantity level simultaneously and independently of each other. 

In examples so far, players choose from a finite set of actions, but games and the nash equilibrium concept can be extended to situations where players have an infinity of actions

A cournot oligopoly is a model in which firms choose their quantity level, simultaneously and independently of the ofther firm. A duopoly is an oligopoly with only two firms
	in the duopoly model, firms one and two are the players and the actions they choose are their own quantity levels q1 and q2 where q1>0 and q2>0
	assuming the firms maximize profit and they have a constant marginal cost equal to c
	asume linear inverse demand function p(Q)
In the cournot duopoly model firms compete by choosing their output quantitites. What if, instead, they compete y choosing prices at which they are willing to sell
	bertrand competition
bertrand modedl:
	There are two firms with identical cost functions C(qi)=cqi(i.e., constant MC)
	Firms choose prices: firm 1 chooses p1>=0 and firm 2 chooses p2>=0
	As before, market demand is D(p)
	BUT:	Consumers buy from the firm iwht the lowest price
		if prices are the same (p1=p2), then the two firms split the market equally
Again, here two firms compete by choosing prices, but they can choose any price.	
	firm one chooses p1>=0 and firm 2 chooses p2>=0
	both firms have a cost function C(qi)=cqi (i.e., constant MC)
	Consumers buy from the firm with the lowest price
	if prices are the same (p1=p2), then the two firms split the market equally
recall key property of Nash Equilibrium: neither firm has a unilateral incentive to change
	note: we can rule our prices below the marginal cost (becuase firms would be making negative profit) and, if any firm quotes a price strictly above the marginal cost, the other firm can undercut

Comparitive statics in duopoly competition
	Nash equilibrium permits us to understand strategic interaction between firms in a noligopoly
		solutoin depends on fthe parameter of the modedl
		so what happens when such parameters change?
	Comparatitve statics studies how equilibrium changes when something in the model changes
	example: change in the unit cost of production. Suppose that the unit cost of both firms changes from c0 to c1>c0. How does the NE of the cournot model change?
		the competitive and monopoly equilibrium quantities q^M and q^C would both decline
		the best response function of each firm shifts down
		the total quantity declines and the market price increases
r

pass through cost increase to price under cornot is dp/dc = 2/3

what if only the cost of one firm changes?

when the demand is p=a-q1-q2 and the unit costs of the two firms are c1 and c2, respectively, we find :
(see slides)

monopoly, oligopoly and market power: the big picture
	monopoly makes it clear why market power is important and how it matters
	market power permis supra-competitive profit by limiting production and raising prices beyond mc 
		good for monopolistic firm, bad for society 
	oligopoly highlights important of firms' strategic interaction
		exercise of market poer limited by competition between firms; mode of competition matters a lot
		cornot(quantity) copmetition
		bertrand(price) competition same outcome as perfectly competittive markets!

short term, they do it cornot as they dont want to lower prices to the point they can't produce enough. 
Long term, it goes more to bertrand because they can keep lowering the price to monopoly levels. 

cheating also escapes the bertrand paradox n shit

Oligopoly and the loss of market power due to competition
------------
competition is bad from theperspective of oligopoly firms
	relative to monopoly, competition (both cornot and bertrand) increses total output and reduces price an total industry profit
	price competition (->bertrand paradox) is particularly bad for firms
Each firm acts selfishly and independently it's action may negativley affect the profitability of other firms, but they do not care about htis "externailty"
	examples: cournot competitior or Bertrand competitor
firms in an oligopoly have a clear incentive to coordinate their ation in orde rto increase profits... strategies and behavior in the pursuit of that goal are generically referred to a socllusion
collusive behaviro can take several firms
	explicit price fixing (a cartel)
	tacit collusion (informal understanding)
Cartel
--------
A cartel is a group of firms that coordinate their pricing and output activities
	if the cartel includes every firm in the industry, it is effectively a monopoly
	if it includes only the largest firms, it is effectively a monopolist with a competitive fringe
	the typical objective is to restrict supply and or increase price
		industry moves closer to monoopoly solution(highest industry profit)
A famous example: the Diamond cartel
	diamods were discovered in south africa in 1867. 
		before that they were only found in india and brazil
	Econonmy of scale in diamond digging lead to consolidation
	In 1887, thanks to efforts of Cecil Rhodes, the DeBeers Mining Company was created
		Dominance of south african diamond mining
		created distribution channel the "diamond syndicate"
		by beginning of 20th century, DeBeers controlled 90% of the world diamond market
		Early awareness that high prices were related to the notion of scarcity
		advertizing strategy to bring diamonds to the general public "diamonds are forever" aka not to be resold
How did the cartel work?
	Own a large share of mining operations and persuade other suppliers to work otgetther
	Key tool: the Centeral Selling Organization
		Centralizes acquisition of rough cut diamonds for grading and resale
		Offer opprotunity for control of output put on the marke tand prices offered to producers and charged to dealers
		delares fear being excluded from "sight" ssale events
	Threat of retaliation to ensure compliance
The lure, and risks of collusion
	Collusion clearly cna increase the total profit of firms that operate in an oligopoly
	why are not all industries organized as cartels?
	Price fixing is illegal in the US (Sherman Act of 1890 and other antitirust legislation) and in many other countries
	Some international cartels are not illegal (OPEC)
How collusion can happen: repeated interactions
	A major reason why collusion is diffictult to rationalize in the foregoing model is that firms only interact once "one shot game"
		Temptation to "cheat" is irresistible for players because "there is no tomorrow"
	An alternative (more ralistic) assumption is to presuem that firms interact many times
	if firma operate in the same market for a long period of time, they get to choose theri prices time and time again. 
		the strategic interaction between firms can be modeled as a "repeated game"
		in a repeated game, firms can influence each other by signanling thier intention ot ocllude 
		other firms can "punish" firms for cheating
	Collusion can become a self-inforced nash equillibrium


Repeated games
	a game where players play the sam stage game more than once
(see illustration)
ut suppose that htis game is played an indefinite number of times.
	at each "stage" players make their choices and get hte payoff, sas per the above tbale
	after each stage, ther is a probibiltiy > 0 that the game will be played again
	because at any stage a player can choose actions depending on what was chosen in past staes, players can use their action to signal their willingness to copoperate with the other player, and or can use their action to punish the other player for actions taken tin the past
	Note: the notion of retaliation
in this repeated game setting, can "cooperation" be sustained? as a nash equilibrium
	for this outcome, we ned to find an angreement that is a nash equilibrium
	--recall: nash equilibrium actions are self-enforcing!
Players chosse C for a while until one player decides to cheat and play D. If one of the players cheats, the other person will play D forever. 

the same thing happens if you put numbers into the thing

the parameter \greekletter has been interpreted so far as the probablility of future interactions
	A more standard story is that firms are sure they will e interacting in thte future, but the fugutre is not bavlued the same as the present - the timve value of money

Concentration and market power
INdustry analyses and policy discussions in industrial organization often relat to tconcentration
	example: antitrust cases related to mergers and acquisition
	but the over arching concern in Industrial orgazinzation relates to market power
how are these two concepts related?
Market power is the bilitiy fo firms to raise price above marginal cost
concentration in a market refers to just how many relevant firms there are 
monopoly N=1
douopoly N = 2
oligoopoply N>2 but N is "small"

how do the duoopoly results change when there are more than 2 firms but n is small

there are n firms, each choosing its quantitiy level zi>=0 independently of the other firms
	firms are identical with cost function C(qi) = cqi (ie, constant MC = c)
	Market price is determined by the linear (inverse) demand function p=a-Q, where Q=q1+q2+...qn

-q+[a-N*q-c] = 0
a-c=q*(N+1)
q*=(a-c)/(N+1)
what each firm will produce in equilibrium

concentration in a market refers to how many relevant firms there are. 
	When all firms are identical, then concentration is simpley described by the number n, but when firms are different--i.e., they have different market shares we need to account for that. 
	a useful measuere is the concentration ratio Cm, the total market share of the m largest firms
	a common used concentration ration is C4=s1+s2+s3+s4 (market share of the top four firms) where xi=qi/Q
	another common measure is the Herfindahl index

market power and concentration measures
	an over-arching motive of interest in Industrial Orgainization relates to market power
	we measure it as the price markup over marginal cost, i.e., (p*-MC)/p*
When firms are not identical (eg, they have different production costs), they will have different cost-price margins (because price is the same for all firms, but MCs are different across firms)
	In such cases, market power is measred byt he lerner index
concentration in a market refers to how many relevant firms there are
	a standard measure of concentration is the Herfindahl index

IF firms compete as in the cournot model, then we can show that Lerner Index = H/-elasticity of demand
	this establishes a clear relationship between market power and concentration
	the higher the market 

in the cornot model with many firms we used the deman dfunction Q=a-p. here we make it a bit more general by using Q=(a-p)S, where S is s a measure of "market size"
	inverse dmenad curve: p= a - (1/s)Q see illustration
also, we allow firms to have a fixed cost f, that is, the cost function is C = cq+F

what determines how many firms are active in a give industry?
	this is the result of firms' entry and exit decisions. our presumption is that;
		if profit is greater than zero, there is an incentive for firms to enter. if profti is less than zero, there is an incentive for firms to exit the industry

the evoloution of concentration: mergers and acquisions
	what determines concentration in any one industry?
		firms entry and exit are things
Another major influence on industry structure is that of Mergers and Acquisitions
	horizontal mergers: mergers between ocmpetitors
	vertical mergers: firms merging in the production/marketing chains
	conglomerate: mergers between loosely related or industry unrelated frims. 
Motivations for mergers and acquisitions
	increase market power/collusion
		two competitors in a duopoly market can improve collusion by gerging and create a monopoly
		collusion is easier in mor concentrated industries
	Exploit cost efficiencies
		reduce overhead duplication and achieve economies of scale
		share technologies
		benefit from complementarities (synergies)
Consider a cournot oligopoly with 3 firms, where market demand is D(p)=a-p
	initially all firms have the same cost function C=F+cq
	in a symmetric equilibrium, all three firms produce the same level of ouptut, obviously get the same price and make the same profit

The department of justice takes care of some of these things. 

Mergers are basically allowed if the herfindahl index is < 1500 and won't change by more than 100 points, suspect if it's moderately concentrate H 1500-2500 and the h will raise by 200 points or so, and if the herfendal index is bigger than 2500, it's likely too concentrated.
