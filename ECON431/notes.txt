Five Forces and industry profitability individual paper thing 8% of grade
	pick a company
	look at the five forces
	make a memo to the president of the company
	2-4 pages.
Team Project:
	regression analysis
	He'll give us a dataset of enrollment at a particular midwestern institution (us)
	we'll come up with a theorhetical model to determine what factors determine enrollment
	we'll come up with a demand curve via regression analysis
	show off the results, implications, and such
	some of the data he gives us might not be used btw. 
	start with a full model and whittle it down to a set of things that work.
	Write a memo to the president less than 2 pages. start with a punchline "our policy recommendation is..."
	The other paper is to the professor 3-5 pages: walk through the process and convince him that we've done a good job

In economics we make decisions on the margin

Economics: The study of the allocation of scare resources to produce goods and services and to allocate them for consumption among competing and unlimited wants. 

Production is a function of Labor and Capital

Consumer noncessation: unlimited wants

Pareto efficiency: you cannot make one person better off without making someone worse off. 

Corporate social responsibility
Milton Friedman: make money and dont break the rules.

Time value of money
Presenvt value of an amount to be received at the end of "n" periods when the per period interest rate is I

PV=(FV/(1+i)^n)
quantity demanded of x:
	inputs, effect on quantity
	price,negative
	price of othergoods, depends
	population, positive

supply Quantity of x:
	inputs, effect on quantity
	price of good, positive
	Price of inputs, negative
	wage, negative
	taxes, negative
	number of firms, positive
	technology, positive
Taxes and things.

market interventions:
	price ceilings
	price floors
	they have to do something to be effective
	they need to be below or above the equilibrium proce before they matter
Elasticity = Unit free maeasure of the responsiveness of demand given a change in a variable (usually price)

Hicks Marshall 
	1. The greater the share of your purse that a project is, the more elastic it is due to how much you care
	2. the time horizon of purchase
	3. number of substitutes
marginal rate of substitution = (-MUx/MUy) 
U = x^\alpha y^\beta
mux = \alpha X^(\alpha-1)y^\beta
MRS = \alpha/\beta * Y/X

M = Px*X+Py*yy
it's how much of each good you can afford given income M


Ladership quote of the day: 
life is connected. Where you are today is a result of decisions you made in the past and where you will be tomorow in every area of your life, is connected to what you do today and what you do
