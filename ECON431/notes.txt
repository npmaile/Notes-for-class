Managerial Economics
Know your data. Know yourself
People be getting ocllege degrees fam
When you're working with data, be a little bit skeptical

8%	of the grade is attendance, class participation, and team evaluation
23%	exam
23%	quizzes once every 3 weeks
8%	five forces current event report

C	73
D	63

Five Forces and industry profitability individual paper thing 8% of grade
	pick a company
	look at the five forces
	make a memo to the president of the company
	2-4 pages.
Team Project:
	regression analysis
	He'll give us a dataset of enrollment at a particular midwestern institution (us)
	we'll come up with a theorhetical model to determine what factors determine enrollment
	we'll come up with a demand curve via regression analysis
	show off the results, implications, and such
	some of the data he gives us might not be used btw. 
	start with a full model and whittle it down to a set of things that work.
	Write a memo to the president less than 2 pages. start with a punchline "our policy recommendation is..."
	The other paper is to the professor 3-5 pages: walk through the process and convince him that we've done a good job

Managerial Economics
--------------------
Why do people go to college?
	money.
What are the marginal costs of college
	tuition
	can't work while in school
	can't learn a trade while at school
	delta housing
	books (lol)
	delta food
	delta clothing

What are the marginal benefits of college
	higher wages later on
	career exploration


In economics we make decisions on the margin

Economics: The study of the allocation of scare resources to produce goods and services and to allocate them for consumption among competing and unlimited wants. 

Production is a function of Labor and Capital

Consumer noncessation: unlimited wants

Pareto efficiency: you cannot make one person better off without making someone worse off. 

Corporate social responsibility
Milton Friedman: make money and dont break the rules.

Time value of money
Presenvt value of an amount to be received at the end of "n" periods when the per period interest rate is I

PV=(FV/(1+i)^n)
quantity demanded of x:
	inputs, effect on quantity
	price,negative
	price of othergoods, depends
	population, positive

supply Quantity of x:
	inputs, effect on quantity
	price of good, positive
	Price of inputs, negative
	wage, negative
	taxes, negative
	number of firms, positive
	technology, positive
Taxes and things.

market interventions:
	price ceilings
	price floors
	they have to do something to be effective
	they need to be below or above the equilibrium proce before they matter
Elasticity = Unit free maeasure of the responsiveness of demand given a change in a variable (usually price)

Hicks Marshall 
	1. The greater the share of your purse that a project is, the more elastic it is due to how much you care
	2. the time horizon of purchase
	3. number of substitutes
marginal rate of substitution = (-MUx/MUy) 
U = x^\alpha y^\beta
mux = \alpha X^(\alpha-1)y^\beta
MRS = \alpha/\beta * Y/X

M = Px*X+Py*yy
it's how much of each good you can afford given income M

production functions on the short run
function of kapital and labor = q = total product
grab the production functoin
th derivative with respect to L is the marginal product of labor
the average product of labor is Q/L

Marginal product of labor is 0 at the top of the curve of output per labor
when marginal product of labor is equal to average product of labor, the average product is highest
this hapens after the inflection point of the production function when marginal product is highest

Marginal Value Product (VMPL) = additional output of one more worker * the price of output aka the benefit of hiring a worker

if additional benefits are greater than the costs, then adding the control variable is a good move. That means hire a worker if they make you more then they cost you
hire until the value of marginal product is equal to the wage rate

Isoquant
	Qstar = functionof(kapital and labor)

	marginal rate of tech. substitution
	MRTS = Marginal producto of labor/ marginal product of kapital

	firm's problem is to minimize cost subject to Producing level of output Q*
	Minimiz cost subject to Q*
	Cost = wage*Labor+Kaptial rate * Kapital

	RK/r = C/r-WL/r
	K=C/r-(W/R)*L
Decision
MPL*PQ=W
MPK*PQ=r
PQ=W/MPL
1/PQ=MPL/W
1/PQ=MPK/R
MPL/W=MPK/R
in the long run decision rule

Returns to scale
Q=aK+bL = 4K + 5L
if K and L are doubled, Q is doubled
constant returns to scale

Q=4K+5L+3KL
if k and l are doubled Q is more than doubled, increasing returns to scale

Q=5K^1/2*L^1/2
if k and l are doubled Q is doubled constant returns to scale

Q=7kL^1/2
Q1 = 2^3/2 Qo Increasing returns to scale

Qo=8K^1/3*L^1/2
Q=2^1/3+1/2
decreasing Returns to scale


given cobb douglas Q=Ak^alpha*L^beta
Increasing returns to scale if alpha plus beta > 1
constant returns to scale if alpha plus beta = 1
decreasing returns to scale if alpha plus beta < 1

all cost functions can be written as a function of output not inputs

Economies of Scope
	when you make two different things and it's cheaper than making them separately

Measures of market power
Learner Index: 
Learner index = (Price-marginal cost)/Price
closer to zero is perfect competition
closer to one is monopolistic

Rothschild index:
Rothschild inxex: Ownprice elasticity of the market/ownprice elasticity of the firm
closer to zero is perfect competition
closer to one is monopolistic

HHI:
Herfendal hershman index:
square each firm's share in the market and multiply by 10,000
unconcentrated less than 1000
moderate between 1000 and 1800
high above 1800


C4
four firm concentration ratio:
share of sales in industry from the 4 largest firms
sum of the four divided by the total shares


Ladership quote of the day: 
life is connected. Where you are today is a result of decisions you made in the past and where you will be tomorow in every area of your life, is connected to what you do today and what you do
