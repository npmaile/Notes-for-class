Chapter 2 (see slides)

We look at markets and they tell us exactly what things are worth very well. 
The market is bad at telling the value of the environment as an asset. 

Economists like to go for efficiency. 
Efficiency is a normative statement: how the world should be

positive is a claim about how the world is and can e tested.
Efficiency: maximize producer surplus and consumer surplus

Conditions of goods that help achieve efficient quantities and prices:
	Exclusivity
	tansferability
	enforceability
Externalities:
negative externalities mean that we are producing too much and the price is too low.
