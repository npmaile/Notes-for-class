Chapter 2 (see slides)

We look at markets and they tell us exactly what things are worth very well. 
The market is bad at telling the value of the environment as an asset. 

Economists like to go for efficiency. 
Efficiency is a normative statement: how the world should be

positive is a claim about how the world is and can e tested.
Efficiency: maximize producer surplus and consumer surplus

Conditions of goods that help achieve efficient quantities and prices:
	Exclusivity
	tansferability
	enforceability
Externalities:
negative externalities mean that we are producing too much and the price is too low. 

sum demand functions vertically for public goods
sum demand functions horizontally for private goods

public goods are about fixed quanitites, but the prices vary per person

Evaluating tradeoffs and benefit-cost-analysis
	benefit-cost analysis
		if benefits are greaer than costs, take action
		passing a benefit-cost test does not imply optimality

	net benefits and static efficicency
		up to this point, we've assumed time isn't imortant
		many cases where time is important
			exhaustible resources
			renewable resources
			stock pollutants (persist and accumulate over time)
		how do we make choices when benefits and costs occur at different points in time following from some action today?
	present value
	dynamic efficiency
	regulatory context
	risk and CBA
	cost-effectiveness
Present value calculations
	it's the same equation we've had in every 200+ finance/econ course
	pv(x) = X/(1+r)^t
Total value = Use Value + Option Value + Non-Use Value
	use: value of directly using it
	option: value of having it to consume later
	non-use: value of its existence without ever using it
The hedonic price approach
	the level of environmental quality can be considered a qualitative characteristic of a differentiated market good
	individuals have some freedom to choose thier consumption
		through their selection of a private consumption bundle
	assumes complementarity b/w the public good and the market good
	The market for the differentiated privae good functions as a market for the public good or enviornmental quality
	where choises are possible, people dont think it be like it is, but it do.
